"other.  This struggle explains the mystery, joy, chaos, and misery of life.\n"
"<header>text='Legends'</header>\n"
"According to South-Seas beliefs, the struggle of the gods roughly falls into "

"triumph.  \n"
"\n"
"Legends passed down through many generations do speak of a time when there "
"was a great evil.  The name of this evil has been forgotten, for the older "
"generations were reluctant to utter it.  The evil was motivated by neither "
"chaos nor death, but rather the complete annihilation of all.  Aruyun, "
"Athtep, and all of the gods of the world united to defeat this evil, "
"splitting it into two components much like they themselves were divided.  "
"One half was a cold, lifeless, and listless force that bore a strong "
"resemblance to death.  The other half was passionate and full of life, but "
"lacked direction and was much weakened without the cold logic of the other "
"half.  The enemy was now split into components that fit within the "
"understanding of the world; it was of this world, and could not carry out "
"its original mission.  There is always a fear that the two parts could re-"
"unite, but most modern South-Seafarers do not really believe these tales."
